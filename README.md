#  Gen AI Training – Learn Python & Machine Learning in 7 Days!

Welcome to this mini training program where you’ll learn the basics of Python Machine Learning (ML) the building blocks of Generative AI (Gen AI).



Day 1: Python Basics (Part 1)
On the first day, we’ll start from scratch!

- What is Python?
- How to take input and show output?
- Using if-else and loops (for, while)
- Solving simple problems like:
  - Check even or odd
  - Print multiplication table
  - Find largest of three numbers

 Day 2: Python Basics (Part 2)
Let’s go deeper into Python.

- What are functions and how to use them
- Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries (important for ML)
- Try-catch (Exception Handling)
- Intro to NumPy and Pandas

 Day 3: Machine Learning Starts!
Now we enter the world of ML 

- What is Machine Learning? How is it different from AI?
- Types of ML: Supervised, Unsupervised
- Simple model: Linear Regression
  

 Day 4: Classification Model
We’ll build a model that can classify things (like predicting if a person will buy a product or not)

- Logistic Regression
- Train-Test Split
- Accuracy Score and Confusion Matrix
